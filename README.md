FootballApplication

This is a simple live football statistics application user interface. This is developed with the idea to track events as it is happening in real time when a match is being played( though it is still a work in progress with no events incorporated in the controls yet). This application is developed with JavaFX framework, together with Scenebuilder for outlaying the interface and controls as well as bit of CSS.

Getting Started

These instructions will enable you run the application on your local machine;

Prerequisites

At least Java SDK 11 (JDK 11-JDK 13 will require the Open JavaFX 11 SDK)
An Integrated Development Environment (Preferably Intellij IDEA used to developed the program).

Testing

This project includes a runnable jar(FootballApplication.jar) file that can be used to quickly run the current state of the application. The location of this jar file is in out/artifacts/FootballApplication_jar/FootballApplication.jar. Which can be run directly on the Intelli J IDEA.
This jar can be run through the command prompt opened in that(out/artifacts/..) location by typing "java --module-path "Javafx path location(in your local machine)" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar FootballApplication.jar FootballApp" without the quotes. In addition, there is a windows batch file name RunApp.bat that you can double click to run the app instantly located in the out/artifacts/FootballApplication_jar/RunApp.bat folder used in windows operating system.
